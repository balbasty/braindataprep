# OASIS-I: Cross-sectional data across the adult lifespan (Marcus et al., 2007)

## Quotes from the original fact sheet

### Sumary

OASIS provides brain imaging data that are freely available for distribution
and data analysis. This data set consists of a cross-sectional collection of
416 subjects covering the adult life span aged 18 to 96 including individuals
with early-stage Alzheimer's Disease (AD). For each subject, 3 or 4 individual
T1-weighted MRI scans obtained within a single imaging session are included.
The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 100 of the
included subjects over the age of 60 have been diagnosed with very mild to
mild AD. Additionally, for 20 of the nondemented subjects, images from a
subsequent scan session after a short delay (less than 90 days) are also
included as a means of assessing acquisition reliability.

All data have been anonymized to accommodate public distribution.
Facial features were removed at the fMRIDC (http://www.fmridc.org)
using the Brain Extraction Tool.

The full set is 15.8 GB compressed and 50 GB uncompressed.
The data are available at http://www.oasis-brains.org.

### Image Data

For each subject, a number of images are provided, including:

    1.  3-4 images corresponding to multiple repetitions of the same
        structural protocol within a single session to increase
        signal-to-noise,
    2.  an average image that is a motion-corrected coregistered average
        of all available data,
    3.  a gain-field corrected atlasregistered image to the 1988 atlas
        space of Talairach and Tournoux (Buckner et al., 2004),
    4.  a masked version of the atlas-registered image in which all
        non-brain voxels have been assigned an intensity value of 0, and
    5.  a grey/white/CSF segmented image (Zhang et al., 2001).

All images are in 16-bit big-endian Analyze 7.5 format.
