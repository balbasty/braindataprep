# OASIS-3

_Longitudinal Multimodal Neuroimaging, Clinical, and Cognitive Dataset
for Normal Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease_ (LaMontagne et al. 2019)

## Quotes from the original fact sheet

### Sumary

OASIS-3 is a retrospective compilation of data for 1378 participants that
were collected across several ongoing projects through the WUSTL Knight
ADRC over the course of 30years. Participants include 755 cognitively
normal adults and 622 individuals at various stages of cognitive decline
ranging in age from 42-95yrs. All participants were assigned a new random identifier and all dates were removed and normalized to reflect days from
entry into study. The dataset contains 2842 MR sessions which include
T1w, T2w, FLAIR, ASL, SWI, time of flight, resting-state BOLD, and DTI sequences. Many of the MR sessions are accompanied by volumetric
segmentation files produced through FreeSurfer processing. PET imaging
from different tracers, PIB, AV45, and FDG, totaling over 2157 raw
imaging scans and the accompanying post-processed files from the Pet
Unified Pipeline (PUP) are also available in OASIS-3. Additionally,
451 Tau PET sessions and post-processed PUP are now available for
OASIS-3 subjects in a sub-project ‘OASIS-3_AV1451’.

## Forms

It seems that the "old" NACC-UDS form (v2) was administered. The main
difference relates to the neuropsychological battery test, which used
to be C1 (v2) and is now C2 (v3).
