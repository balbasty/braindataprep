# OASIS-II: Longitudinal MRI Data in Nondemented and Demented Older Adults (Marcus et al., 2010)

## Quotes from the original fact sheet

### Sumary

This set consists of a longitudinal collection of 150 subjects aged 60
to 96. Each subject was scanned on two or more visits, separated by at
least one year for a total of 373 imaging sessions. For each subject,
3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained in single scan
sessions are included. The subjects are all right-handed and include
both men and women. 72 of the subjects were characterized as
nondemented throughout the study. 64 of the included subjects were
characterized as demented at the time of their initial visits and
remained so for subsequent scans, including 51 individuals with mild
to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Another 14 subjects were characterized
as nondemented at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently
characterized as demented at a later visit.
